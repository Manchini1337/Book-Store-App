# React recruitment task

I've found [this recruitment task](https://gitlab.gwo.pl/recruitment/react-task) on the internet.

I've deployed API to heroku [here.](https://bookstore-task-api.herokuapp.com/api/book) 

All the front end requirements (react, app-wide state management, pages, order form, order form validation) were met. I've also implemented shopping cart navbar.

You can test the website [here.](https://bookstore-task-front.herokuapp.com/)

* Please take into account that heroku app might take a moment to load.
